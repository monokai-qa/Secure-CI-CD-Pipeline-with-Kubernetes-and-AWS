# Secure-CI-CD-Pipeline-with-Kubernetes-and-AWS

I'll build a secure CI/CD pipeline that deploys a web application (e.g., a simple Node.js app) into a Kubernetes cluster running on AWS, using Terraform, Ansible, and security best practices.

Tech Stack:
* AWS: EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
* Kubernetes: Cluster setup, Helm charts, deployments
* Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for AWS resources
* Ansible: Configuration management & provisioning
* Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab CI: CI/CD pipeline automation
* Docker: Containerization
* Prometheus & Grafana: Monitoring & logging
* AWS Security Best Practices: IAM, Security Groups, Secrets Management (AWS Secrets Manager)
* DevSecOps Tools: Trivy (for container security), Falco (runtime security)

Project Breakdown
Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup with Terraform

✅ Use Terraform to provision AWS infrastructure:
* Create a VPC, subnets, security groups
* Deploy an EKS (Kubernetes) cluster
* Setup an S3 bucket for Terraform state storage
* Configure IAM roles & policies securely

Phase 2: Kubernetes Cluster Setup & Deployment

✅ Deploy a simple Node.js or Python Flask app in a Docker container

❌ Use Helm charts to manage Kubernetes deployments

❌ Implement Ingress Controller for traffic routing

Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Automation

❌ Use Jenkins/GitHub Actions to:
* Build & push Docker images to Amazon ECR
* Deploy to Kubernetes using Helm
* Run security scans using Trivy
* Run container runtime security with Falco

Phase 4: Security Hardening (DevSecOps)

❌ Implement IAM best practices (least privilege access)

❌ Set up AWS Security Hub & CloudTrail for auditing

❌ Enable network policies in Kubernetes

❌ Scan Docker images before deployment using Trivy

Phase 5: Monitoring & Logging

❌ Use Prometheus & Grafana to collect and visualize metrics

❌ Implement ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging

Bonus: Automate Everything with Ansible
Once everything is working, use Ansible to:
* Automate Kubernetes deployments
* Configure AWS services
* Manage security policies

Next Steps

🔥 Pick a cloud provider account (AWS Free Tier) 

🔥 Start with Terraform to create the basic AWS setup 

🔥 Document everything in GitHub (README, Terraform files, Ansible playbooks)
